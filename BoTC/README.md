Here I will write about my projects regarding my favorite social deduction game 'Blood on The Clocktower'.

I would like to create a program (an app for Android & iOS ideally, but that I would probably do in C#) that will save time preparing scenarios and manage the game flow.
I will start with a role distributor program. I want the program to be able to get different settings as input (e.g. number of players, difficulty, playstyle) and then as output give me set of roles.
