What can it do:
- display points
- display team names
- display sets
- increment points & sets by one using a button
- display a box in the center that is supposed to be playing field

What I want it to be able to do:
- display lineup
- display teams on correct halves of the field
- end the set automatically when one team scores >= 25 points while having having 2 point advantage over opposite team; add +1 set to winning team
- perform rotations
- substitutions
- display proper field
